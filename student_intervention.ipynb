    "**Answer: **\n",
    "Support Vector Machine is a classification computational algorithm. By classification we means the action of grouping objects according to shared qualities or characteristics. The human brain perform such task by separating objects with similar characteristics. Humans usually separate the objects apart by creating enough physical space between them so a second observer can easily perceive them as 2 separate classes of the same object. Example of this is a table with ping pong balls of 2 different colors (blue and purple) if we separate them but the space we leave between the 2 groups is not larger enough an observer requires to be close to the table to differentiate them, so the more space we put between the 2 type of balls the better the observer will be able to distinguish the 2 classe. It is important to notice that the space between ball of different colors will be the distance between the closest blue and purple color balls.\n",
    "\n",
    "A support Vector Machine is a programatically way to instruct a computer to do exactly what a human does but instead of doing it in a physical world it is done in a digital one. In the digital world and using the same example of the previous paragraph, the color balls become just color dots in a  screen, SVM using a coordinate system map all the dots location on the screen and them draws lines over the closest 2 dots of different colors. The distance between those 2 lines is equivalent to the space humans produce by separting the balls on the table. That space is called the \"marging\". Same as in the physical world the larger the marging the better an observer can separate the type of objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "Going back the the example of the balls in a physical world, let us say that the blue balls are encircling the purple ones. A person has to be more resourceful and separate them without re-arrange them. It does it by creating a surronding space between the 2 colors. Computers can't do the same using the line trick with learned before so what a computer does is add more space dimensions to do the trick. If you have been in a movie theather recently you probably has watch a 3D movie. In a 3D movie you see all kind of objects getting out of screen while others stays behind. You know that the movie screen is flat so there is trick done by the camera that produces that effect. That is exacly what the SVM program does it raises the purple dots leaving behind the blues and now the 2 dots types are separated in a 3D space. After the separation is done SVM slices both groups with what will look like in the real world as a sheet of paper, that sheet of paper is called a \"hyperplane\". If all the sudden the 3D dissapears this hyperplane will left behind a circular line that separate the colors dots. This trick that projects the dots in a 3D dimesion and creates the circular separation is achived by adding to KVM program a mathematical helper function called the kernel.  "
